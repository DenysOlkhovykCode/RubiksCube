# 3D Rubik's Cube Application

This is a 3D graphics application built using the Qt framework that allows users to interact with a Rubik's Cube in a playful manner. The application enables free rotation of the cube and manipulation of its faces to solve the puzzle. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of Qt in developing intuitive and interactive 3D applications.

## Features

- **3D Rubik's Cube**: A fully functional, interactive Rubik's Cube.
- **Smooth Controls**: Intuitive controls for rotating and twisting the cube's sides.
- **User Interaction**: Rotate the cube freely and manipulate individual faces to solve the puzzle.
- **Qt Framework**: Developed using the Qt framework, showcasing its capabilities in 3D graphics and user interface design.

## Technologies Used

- **Qt Framework**: Used for rendering 3D graphics and handling user interaction.
- **C++**: Core programming language for the application logic.

## How to Use

1. **Rotate the Cube**: Click and drag on the cube to rotate it in any direction.
2. **Twist the Cube Faces**: Select individual cube faces and twist them by dragging the mouse.
3. **Solve the Puzzle**: Keep twisting the faces until all sides of the cube have the same color, solving the Rubik's Cube.
